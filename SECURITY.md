## Reporting a Vulnerability

When discovering a vulnerability please create a new issue providing a step by step guide
for reproduction. The title of the issue should be a brief summary of the vulnerability type.

## Rewards
Any researcher that reports a vulnerability will be mentioned in the projects readme as a thank-you
the moment the vulnerability is validated, NOT when fixed.
